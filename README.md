## Analyzing borrowers’ Risks of Defaulting

The aim of this project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We need to find out if a customer’s marital status, number of children, or any other
factor has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The assumed bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

This report will be considered when building a **credit scoring** of a potential customer. A **credit scoring** is used to evaluate the ability of a potential 
borrower to repay their loan.
